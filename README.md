how  implement (linear regression and classification)
use several ways 
linear regression:
cost function 
gradient descent 
mean normalize 
regulraization
feature engineering 

logistic regression:
sigmoid function 
cost function 
gradient descent 
mean normalize 
regulraization
feature engineering
